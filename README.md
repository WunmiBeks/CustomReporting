# 📊 Marketing Cloud Campaign Performance Reporting - CloudPage

## Overview

This task showcases a CloudPage built to monitor the performance of an ongoing three-email campaign journey promoting a special discount offer.
Each email in the journey contains a “Claim Now” CTA button that leads customers to a landing page where they can claim their discount code.
The CloudPage displays key campaign metrics in real-time, combining data from SFMC data views and the ClaimedDiscounts Data Extension. This allows the Marketer to view campaign performance metrics as engagement and claims occur.
